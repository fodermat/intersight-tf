This sample allows to create a new Server Profile with a few Policies in an existing ORG.
Mac pool is also already deployed on Intersight, read as data.
Blade where SP is assigned is located based on Serial Number. Asset tag would also work as identifier to fetch MOID.
Note that Deploy action has to be triggered separately, once the SP is assigned to the server.
